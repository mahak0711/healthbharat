               <p>Pulmonary" refers to anything related to the lungs. The term is often used in the context of pulmonary medicine or pulmonology, which is a medical specialty that focuses on the respiratory system. Here are some key aspects related to "pulmonary":</p> <br>
            </div>
                   <h3> Pulmonary System:</h3>
                    
                   <p> <li>The pulmonary system, also known as the respiratory system, includes the organs involved in breathing. This primarily consists of the lungs but also involves other structures such as the airways, blood vessels, and muscles involved in breathing.</p><br></li>
                   <b> Function of the Lungs:</b><br>
                    
                   <li> The primary function of the lungs is to facilitate the exchange of gases, specifically oxygen and carbon dioxide, between the air we breathe and our bloodstream. Oxygen is taken in, and carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, is expelled.<br></li>
                    <b>Pulmonary Diseases:</b><br>
                    
                   <li> Pulmonary diseases are conditions that affect the lungs and respiratory system. Common examples include:<br></li>
                    <ul><li><b>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):</b> A group of progressive lung diseases, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema, that make it difficult to breathe.<br></li>
                    <li><b>Asthma:</b> A chronic condition characterized by inflammation of the airways, leading to symptoms like wheezing, shortness of breath, and coughing.<br></li>
                    <li><b> Pneumonia: </b>Inflammation of the lung tissue, often caused by infection.<br></li>
                   <li> <b>Lung Cancer:</b> Uncontrolled growth of abnormal cells in the lungs.<br></li>
                   <li> <b> Pulmonary Embolism:</b> A blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries, usually caused by a blood clot.</li></ul>
                    <b>Pulmonary Function Tests (PFTs):</b><br>
                    
                    <li>These are diagnostic tests that assess the functionality of the lungs. PFTs measure how well the lungs take in and exhale air and how efficiently they transfer oxygen into the bloodstream.</li><br>
                    <b>Pulmonologist:</b><br>
                    
                   <li> A pulmonologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary (lung) conditions. They may also deal with sleep disorders related to breathing.<br></li>
                    <b>Pulmonary Rehabilitation:</b>
                    <p><li>A program designed to help people with chronic respiratory diseases improve their lung function and overall well-being through exercise, education, and support.<br><br></li>
                    Understanding pulmonary health is crucial for overall well-being, as the lungs play a vital role in providing the body with the oxygen it needs for various physiological processes. Regular exercise, avoidance of smoking, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are key components of maintaining pulmonary health.</p>
